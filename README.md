# Self Balancing Trees based Data Structures


Rebalancing trees, also known as self-balancing trees, are a type of data structure that automatically adjust their shape or structure to maintain a balanced state. These trees are designed to ensure efficient operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching by keeping the tree height balanced.

The primary purpose of rebalancing trees is to prevent degeneration into inefficient or degenerate cases that can occur in traditional binary search trees (BSTs). Without rebalancing, certain operations in BSTs, such as searching or inserting in a specific order, can lead to skewed or unbalanced trees, resulting in poor performance.

Rebalancing trees employ various algorithms and techniques to maintain balance. Some commonly used rebalancing tree data structuresm that are implemented in this repo are:

 - AVL Trees: AVL trees ensure balance by maintaining a height difference (balance factor) of at most 1 between the left and right subtrees of each node.

 - Red-Black Trees: Red-Black trees are binary search trees with additional coloring rules that ensure balance. They guarantee that no path from the root to a leaf is more than twice as long as any other path.

Rebalancing trees offer efficient operations with guaranteed worst-case time complexity, ensuring balanced performance in various scenarios. They are widely used in a range of applications, including databases, compilers, file systems, and more.

## Requirements

- C++
- Ubuntu

## Structure

There are two main folders each having code for a data structure,

- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree

Each folder has a make file that helps in compilation the code.

## Usage

simply run the terminal and go to the directory that contains the AVL Tree downloaded code, and run the commands below:


```
$ make
$ ./avl_tree
```

Here are screenshots of a input of length 5 numbers that are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in same sequence as mentioned, were gives to AVL tree and it generated a tree as shown in cli screenshot, where tree was printed in in-order way of tree printing, for reference a tree was generated on a [visualization website](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html)  with same input and it can be seen that tree generated by code is correct, btw height in cli output starts from 0 where as in reference it starts from 1.

For Red-Black tree, run the commands below:


```
$ make
$ ./red_black_tree
```
